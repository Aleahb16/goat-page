<h2>Who is Jesus?</h2>

<font size="4">Jesus is a second chance. He is the Son of God, the Messiah, the Savior of man. He is love, peace, forgiveness<br> 
and a million other wonderful things. He is the perfect role model for how we should be <br> 
as human beings and serves as a constant reminder that each and every single one <br>
of us is loved enough for his ultimate sacrifice; his crucifixion to save us from eternal death.</font></p>

<h2>What is he great at?</h2>
<font size="4"><p>Simply everything! Jesus was human, but he was the only perfect one.<br>
    Like a human he faced troubles, hardships, and temptations, but being the Son of God,<br>
    embodied with the Holy Spirit, he was able to overcome sin and sacrifice himself for the rest of us <br>
    who could not. During his time on earth, he healed, he taught, he fed, and most importantly he saved. <br>
    Some of the things he did was heal people with leprosy, gave sight to the blind, cast demons<br>
    out of the possessed, turned the lost to the Lord, brought peace to the troubled,<br>
    and made himself known as The Savior. He was nothing but the perfect human example<br> 
    of the Lord's everlasting love for mankind.</p></font>
