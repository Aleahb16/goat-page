<h2>Who is Jesus?</h2>
<img src="images/bible.jpg" width = 200 height = 150>
<p><font size="4">Jesus is a second chance. He is the Son of God, the Messiah, the Savior of man. He is love, peace, forgiveness
and a million<br> other wonderful things. He is the perfect role model for how we should be
as human beings and serves as a constant reminder<br> that each and every single one
of us is loved enough for his ultimate sacrifice; his crucifixion to save us from eternal death.</font></p>

<h2>What is he great at?</h2>
<font size="4"><p>Simply everything! Jesus was human, but he was the only perfect one.<br>
    Like a human he faced troubles, hardships, and temptations, but being the Son of God,<br>
    embodied with the Holy Spirit, he was able to overcome sin and sacrifice himself for the<br> rest of us
    who could not. During his time on earth, he healed, he taught, he fed, and most<br> importantly he saved.
    Some of the things he did was heal people with leprosy, gave sight<br> to the blind, cast demons
    out of the possessed, turned the lost to the Lord, brought peace<br> to the troubled,
    and made himself known as The Savior. He was nothing but the perfect<br> human example of the Lord's everlasting love for mankind.</p></font>
